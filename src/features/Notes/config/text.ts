  "This chart is made from an HOA viewer's perspective with help from the nopixel wiki which may be outdated.",
  "I loosely placed common allies near one another. In doing so, it revealed that alliances seem to congregate around weapons benches. In hindsight this should've been obvoius to me.",
  "Interestingly Speedy's students Siz (HOA) and Benji (SS) both have similar looking heat maps to ESV, branching wide across many factions. These three group also hold the record for most active allies. HOA: 10, ESV: 10, SS: 7.",
  'By contrast CG & CB members have multiple sub-groups within their main factions creating strong internal alliances.',
  'The CG x HOA alliance has proven to be the most dense region of the chart. This may change as SS is slowly being pulled into the Cerebus x CB x ESV orbit.',
  "Olga, while not being a faction seems significant due to her bench. This is the only bench that isn't backed by a single faction.",
  "CG appears to be the only faction that owns/controls two benches although before the SS (Michael Simone's bench) & ESV split, ESV controlled two benches as well. The HOA x Lost bench is the only one that shares blueprints.",
  "I left out some up and coming groups like RM & BCF. I don't have enough data on these groups to justify adding them.",
